## py-motmetrics

The **py-motmetrics** library provides a Python implementation of metrics for benchmarking multiple object trackers (MOT).

While benchmarking single object trackers is rather straightforward, measuring the performance of multiple object trackers needs careful design as multiple correspondence constellations can arise (see image below). A variety of methods have been proposed in the past and while there is no general agreement on a single method, the methods of [[1,2,3,4]](#References) have received considerable attention in recent years. **py-motmetrics** implements these [metrics](#Metrics).

</div>

In particular **py-motmetrics** supports `CLEAR-MOT`[[1,2]](#References) metrics and `ID`[[4]](#References) metrics. Both metrics attempt to find a minimum cost assignment between ground truth objects and predictions. However, while CLEAR-MOT solves the assignment problem on a local per-frame basis, `ID-MEASURE` solves the bipartite graph matching by finding the minimum cost of objects and predictions over all frames. This [blog-post](http://vision.cs.duke.edu/DukeMTMC/IDmeasures.html) by Ergys illustrates the differences in more detail.

### Features at a glance
- *Variety of metrics* <br/>
Provides MOTA, MOTP, track quality measures, global ID measures and more. The results are [comparable](#MOTChallengeCompatibility) with the popular [MOTChallenge][MOTChallenge] benchmarks.
- *Distance agnostic* <br/>
Supports Euclidean, Intersection over Union and other distances measures.
- *Complete event history* <br/> 
Tracks all relevant per-frame events suchs as correspondences, misses, false alarms and switches.
- *Flexible solver backend* <br/> 
Support for switching minimum assignment cost solvers. Supports `scipy`, `ortools`, `munkres` out of the box. Auto-tunes solver selection based on [availability and problem size](#SolverBackends).
- *Easy to extend* <br/> 
Events and summaries are utilizing [pandas][pandas] for data structures and analysis. New metrics can reuse already computed values from depending metrics.

### MOTChallenge compatibility

**py-motmetrics** produces results compatible with popular [MOTChallenge][MOTChallenge] benchmarks. Below are two results taken from MOTChallenge [Matlab devkit][devkit] corresponding to the results of the CEM tracker on the training set of the 2015 MOT 2DMark.

```

TUD-Campus
 IDF1  IDP  IDR| Rcll  Prcn   FAR| GT  MT  PT  ML|   FP    FN  IDs   FM| MOTA  MOTP MOTAL 
 55.8 73.0 45.1| 58.2  94.1  0.18|  8   1   6   1|   13   150    7    7| 52.6  72.3  54.3

TUD-Stadtmitte

```

In comparison to **py-motmetrics**

```
                IDF1   IDP   IDR  Rcll  Prcn GT MT PT ML FP  FN IDs  FM  MOTA  MOTP
TUD-Campus     55.8% 73.0% 45.1% 58.2% 94.1%  8  1  6  1 13 150   7   7 52.6% 0.277
TUD-Stadtmitte 64.5% 82.0% 53.1% 60.9% 94.0% 10  5  4  1 45 452   7   6 56.4% 0.346
```

Besides naming conventions, the only obvious differences are
- Metric `FAR` is missing. This metric is given implicitly and can be recovered by `FalsePos / Frames * 100`.
- Metric `MOTP` seems to be off. To convert compute `(1 - MOTP) * 100`. [MOTChallenge][MOTChallenge] benchmarks compute `MOTP` as percentage, while **py-motmetrics** sticks to the original definition of average distance over number of assigned objects [[1]](#References).

You can compare tracker results to ground truth in MOTChallenge format by
```
python -m motmetrics.apps.eval_motchallenge --help
```
For MOT16/17, you can run
```
python -m motmetrics.apps.evaluateTracking --help
```

### Installation

#### PyPi and development installs

To install **py-motmetrics** use `pip`

```
pip install motmetrics
```

Python 3.5/3.6 and numpy, pandas and scipy is required. If no binary packages are available for your platform and building source packages fails, you might want to try a distribution like Conda (see below) to install dependencies.

Alternatively for developing, clone or fork this repository and install in editing mode.

```
pip install -e <path/to/setup.py>
```

#### Conda
In case you are using Conda, a simple way to run **py-motmetrics** is to create a virtual environment with all the necessary dependencies

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
> activate motmetrics-env
```

Then activate / source the `motmetrics-env` and install **py-motmetrics** and run the tests.

```
activate motmetrics-env
pip install .
pytest
```

In case you already have an environment you install the dependencies from within your environment by

```
conda install --file requirements.txt
pip install .
pytest
```

### Usage

#### Populating the accumulator

```python
import motmetrics as mm
import numpy as np

# Create an accumulator that will be updated during each frame
acc = mm.MOTAccumulator(auto_id=True)

# Call update once for per frame. For now, assume distances between
# frame objects / hypotheses are given.
acc.update(
    ['a', 'b'],                 # Ground truth objects in this frame
    [1, 2, 3],                  # Detector hypotheses in this frame
    [
        [0.1, np.nan, 0.3],     # Distances from object 'a' to hypotheses 1, 2, 3
        [0.5,  0.2,   0.3]      # Distances from object 'b' to hypotheses 1, 2, 3
    ]
)
```

The code above updates an event accumulator with data from a single frame. Here we assume that pairwise object / hypothesis distances have already been computed. Note `np.nan` inside the distance matrix. It signals that `a` cannot be paired with hypothesis `2`. To inspect the current event history simple print the events associated with the accumulator.

```python
print(acc.events) # a pandas DataFrame containing all events

"""
                Type  OId HId    D
FrameId Event
0       0        RAW    a   1  0.1
        1        RAW    a   2  NaN
        2        RAW    a   3  0.3
        3        RAW    b   1  0.5
        4        RAW    b   2  0.2
        5        RAW    b   3  0.3
        6      MATCH    a   1  0.1
        7      MATCH    b   2  0.2
        8         FP  NaN   3  NaN
"""
```

The above data frame contains `RAW` and MOT events. To obtain just MOT events type

```python
print(acc.mot_events) # a pandas DataFrame containing MOT only events

"""
                Type  OId HId    D
FrameId Event
0       6      MATCH    a   1  0.1
        7      MATCH    b   2  0.2
        8         FP  NaN   3  NaN
"""
```

Meaning object `a` was matched to hypothesis `1` with distance 0.1. Similarily, `b` was matched to `2` with distance 0.2. Hypothesis `3` could not be matched to any remaining object and generated a false positive (FP). Possible assignments are computed by minimizing the total assignment distance (Kuhn-Munkres algorithm).

Continuing from above

```python
frameid = acc.update(
    ['a', 'b'],
    [1],
    [
        [0.2], 
        [0.4]
    ]
)
print(acc.mot_events.loc[frameid])

"""
        Type OId  HId    D
Event
2      MATCH   a    1  0.2
3       MISS   b  NaN  NaN
"""
```

While `a` was matched, `b` couldn't be matched because no hypotheses are left to pair with.

```python
frameid = acc.update(
    ['a', 'b'],
    [1, 3],
    [
        [0.6, 0.2],
        [0.1, 0.6]
    ]
)
print(acc.mot_events.loc[frameid])

"""
         Type OId HId    D
Event
4       MATCH   a   1  0.6
5      SWITCH   b   3  0.6
"""
```

`b` is now tracked by hypothesis `3` leading to a track switch. Note, although a pairing `(a, 3)` with cost less than 0.6 is possible, the algorithm prefers prefers to continue track assignments from past frames which is a property of MOT metrics. 

#### Computing metrics
Once the accumulator has been populated you can compute and display metrics. Continuing the example from above

```python
mh = mm.metrics.create()
summary = mh.compute(acc, metrics=['num_frames', 'mota', 'motp'], name='acc')
print(summary)

"""
     num_frames  mota  motp
acc           3   0.5  0.34
"""
```

Computing metrics for multiple accumulators or accumulator views is also possible

```python
summary = mh.compute_many(
    [acc, acc.events.loc[0:1]], 
    metrics=['num_frames', 'mota', 'motp'], 
    names=['full', 'part'])    
print(summary)

"""
      num_frames  mota      motp
full           3   0.5  0.340000
part           2   0.5  0.166667
"""
```

Finally, you may want to reformat column names and how column values are displayed. 

```python
strsummary = mm.io.render_summary(
    summary, 
    formatters={'mota' : '{:.2%}'.format}, 
    namemap={'mota': 'MOTA', 'motp' : 'MOTP'}
)
print(strsummary)

"""
      num_frames   MOTA      MOTP
full           3 50.00%  0.340000
part           2 50.00%  0.166667 
"""
```

For MOTChallenge **py-motmetrics** provides predefined metric selectors, formatters and metric names, so that the result looks alike what is provided via their Matlab `devkit`.

```python
summary = mh.compute_many(
    [acc, acc.events.loc[0:1]], 
    metrics=mm.metrics.motchallenge_metrics, 
    names=['full', 'part'])

strsummary = mm.io.render_summary(
    summary, 
    formatters=mh.formatters, 
    namemap=mm.io.motchallenge_metric_names
)
print(strsummary)

"""
      IDF1   IDP   IDR  Rcll  Prcn GT MT PT ML FP FN IDs  FM  MOTA  MOTP
full 83.3% 83.3% 83.3% 83.3% 83.3%  2  1  1  0  1  1   1   1 50.0% 0.340
part 75.0% 75.0% 75.0% 75.0% 75.0%  2  1  1  0  1  1   0   0 50.0% 0.167
"""
```

In order to generate an overall summary that computes the metrics jointly over all accumulators add `generate_overall=True` as follows

```python
summary = mh.compute_many(
    [acc, acc.events.loc[0:1]], 
    metrics=mm.metrics.motchallenge_metrics, 
    names=['full', 'part'],
    generate_overall=True
    )

strsummary = mm.io.render_summary(
    summary, 
    formatters=mh.formatters, 
    namemap=mm.io.motchallenge_metric_names
)
print(strsummary)

"""
         IDF1   IDP   IDR  Rcll  Prcn GT MT PT ML FP FN IDs  FM  MOTA  MOTP

"""
```

#### Computing distances
Up until this point we assumed the pairwise object/hypothesis distances to be known. Usually this is not the case. You are mostly given either rectangles or points (centroids) of related objects. To compute a distance matrix from them you can use `motmetrics.distance` module as shown below.

##### Euclidean norm squared on points

```python
# Object related points
o = np.array([
    [1., 2],
    [2., 2],
    [3., 2],
])

# Hypothesis related points
h = np.array([
    [0., 0],
    [1., 1],      
])

C = mm.distances.norm2squared_matrix(o, h, max_d2=5.)

"""
[[  5.   1.]
 [ nan   2.]
 [ nan   5.]]
"""
```

##### Intersection over union norm for 2D rectangles
```python
a = np.array([
    [0, 0, 1, 2],    # Format X, Y, Width, Height
    [0, 0, 0.8, 1.5],
])

b = np.array([
    [0, 0, 1, 2],
    [0, 0, 1, 1],
    [0.1, 0.2, 2, 2],
])
mm.distances.iou_matrix(a, b, max_iou=0.5)

"""
[[ 0.          0.5                nan]
 [ 0.4         0.42857143         nan]]
"""
```

<a name="SolverBackends"></a>
#### Solver backends
For large datasets solving the minimum cost assignment becomes the dominant runtime part. **py-motmetrics** therefore supports these solvers out of the box
  - `lapsolver` - https://github.com/cheind/py-lapsolver
  - `lapjv` - https://github.com/gatagat/lap
  - `scipy` - https://github.com/scipy/scipy/tree/master/scipy  
  - `ortools` - https://github.com/google/or-tools
  - `munkres` - http://software.clapper.org/munkres/

A comparison for different sized matrices is shown below (taken from [here](https://github.com/cheind/py-lapsolver#benchmarks))

Please note that the x-axis is scaled logarithmically. Missing bars indicate excessive runtime or errors in returned result. 
![](https://github.com/cheind/py-lapsolver/raw/master/lapsolver/etc/benchmark-dtype-numpy.float32.png)

By default **py-motmetrics** will try to find a LAP solver in the order of the list above. In order to temporarly replace the default solver use

```python
costs = ...
mysolver = lambda x: ... # solver code that returns pairings

with lap.set_default_solver(mysolver): 
    ...
```

### Running tests
**py-motmetrics** uses the pytest framework. To run the tests, simply `cd` into the source directly and run `pytest`.
